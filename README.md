# Go Rest Api Playground
This is but a first interaction with Golang and some of its libraries.

### How to Run
```
docker-compose up --build
```
Will start the backend and database containers.

### Environment file
Should look something like this for the database connection
```
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
```
